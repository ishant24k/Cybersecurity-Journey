# HTB - Meow Box

## Difficulty: Very Easy  
## Type: Linux  
## IP: 10.129.79.56

## Tools Used:
- nmap
- telnet
- cat

## Steps:
1. Ran `nmap -sV 10.129.79.56` and found port 23 (Telnet)
2. Connected using `telnet 10.129.79.56`
3. Used `cat /flag.txt` to get the flag

## What I Learned:
Basic enumeration and using Telnet to connect to a remote service. First hands-on with HTB.
