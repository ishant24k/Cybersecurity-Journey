# TryHackMe – How The Web Works: (How Websites Work)

## How Websites Function:
Websites operate on a client-server model where the browser (client) requests resources from a server.

## Key Points:
- **Frontend** – What users see (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Backend** – Server-side logic, databases
- **Static vs Dynamic** – Fixed content vs generated content

## Example:
Social media sites use dynamic backends to display user-specific feeds.

## What I Learned:
- A single page load involves multiple resources and requests.
