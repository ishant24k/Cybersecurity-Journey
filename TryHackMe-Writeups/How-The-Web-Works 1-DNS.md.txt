# TryHackMe – How The Web Works: (DNS in Detail)

## What is DNS?
The Domain Name System translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

## Key Points:
- **A Record** – IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record** – IPv6 address
- **MX Record** – Mail server
- **CNAME** – Alias for a domain

## Example:
`google.com` → `142.250.190.78`

## What I Learned:
- Without DNS, we’d need to remember numerical IP addresses.
