# TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals: (OSI Model)

## What is the OSI Model?
A conceptual framework describing how data moves through seven layers from one device to another.

## Key Points:
1. Physical – Cables, hardware
2. Data Link – Frames, MAC addresses
3. Network – IP addressing, routing
4. Transport – TCP/UDP, ports
5. Session – Manages connections
6. Presentation – Data formatting
7. Application – Software interface

## Example:
Sending an email passes through all OSI layers before reaching the recipient.

## What I Learned:
- Helps troubleshoot network issues by isolating the problem layer.
