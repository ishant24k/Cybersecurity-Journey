# TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals: (Packets & Frames)

## What are Packets & Frames?
- **Packet** – Data at the Network layer (contains IP info)
- **Frame** – Data at the Data Link layer (contains MAC info)

## Key Points:
- Encapsulation wraps data with headers/footers at each layer.
- Packets travel over networks; frames travel within local segments.

## Example:
A file sent from one computer to another is broken into packets and transmitted as frames over Ethernet.

## What I Learned:
- Packets and frames are essential to data transmission analysis.
