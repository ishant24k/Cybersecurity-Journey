# TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals (What is Networking)

## What is Networking?
The process of connecting computers and devices to share resources and information, enabling communication over short or long distances.

## Key Points:
- **LAN** – Local network within a small area
- **WAN** – Wide-area network over large distances
- **Protocols** – Rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP)

## Example:
Connecting two computers via a switch to share files.

## What I Learned:
- Networking is like a digital postal system.
- Understanding connections is the foundation of cybersecurity.
