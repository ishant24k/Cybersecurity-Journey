# TryHackMe â€“ How The Web Works: (Putting it all Together)

## Full Process of Loading a Website:
1. Type URL in browser.
2. DNS resolves the domain to an IP.
3. Browser connects via TCP.
4. Sends HTTP request.
5. Server responds with HTML/CSS/JS.
6. Browser renders page.

## Example:
Visiting `example.com` triggers DNS, TCP handshake, and HTTP GET before displaying content.

## What I Learned:
- Each stage has its own security risks (DNS spoofing, MITM attacks, etc.).
