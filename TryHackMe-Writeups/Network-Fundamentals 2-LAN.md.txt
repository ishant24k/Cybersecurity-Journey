# TryHackMe – Network Fundamentals: (LAN)

## What is LAN?
A Local Area Network connects devices within a small geographic area such as a home, office, or campus.

## Key Points:
- **Switches/Routers** – Direct traffic within a LAN
- **Topologies** – Star, bus, ring, mesh
- **Speed** – Faster than WAN, low latency

## Example:
An office network connecting computers to a shared printer.

## What I Learned:
- LANs are efficient but must be secured to prevent local attacks.
