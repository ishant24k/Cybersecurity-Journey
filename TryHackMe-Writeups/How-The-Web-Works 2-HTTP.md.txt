# TryHackMe – How The Web Works: (HTTP in Detail)

## What is HTTP?
The HyperText Transfer Protocol defines communication between web browsers and servers.

## Key Points:
- **Methods** – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Status Codes** – 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)
- **HTTPS** – Secure HTTP using TLS/SSL

## Example:
Submitting a form sends a POST request to the server.

## What I Learned:
- HTTP is the backbone of web communication.
